# Chatroom
I made this real-time chatroom application to practice React, Node, UI Development, and Sockets!

## Front-End
The front-end of this application will be build with React. Primarily I want to focus on creating an application that is fundamentally scalable as if this were my real job. So for this I'll be utilizing socket.io in order to maintain modularity and compartmentalization of the app.

I'll try to minimize the use of any additional packages here as I'm really trying to learn about react.

## Back-End
The back-end of this application is going to be a really simple node.js server. Since I primarily focus on the front-end of things, I'm not going to spend as much time engineering this in a conventional way; however, I will make this as neat and organized as possible how I would do it. So bear with me if it's confusing.

#### Side-Notes
This read me should get updated frequently with more information as I develop this.
